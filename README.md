### fpcfingerprinthelper
This repository provides a simple script to help you enable fingerprint login on Linux.

What this script does automatically:
 - Detects your linux distribution
 - Identifies your fingerprint sensor
 - Installs the required packages
In most cases everything runs automatically unless you use the advanced flag

#### Usage
Run the installer in automatic mode:
```console
./install.sh
```
To run the installer in advanced mode:
```
./install.sh advanced
```
**Make the install.sh file executable before running**
